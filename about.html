Hi, I'm Hannibalâ€”a 21-year-old IT student currently studying at MCAST. I'm passionate about technology, gaming, and sports, especially football and Real Madrid. I enjoy learning how things work, solving problems, and bringing creative ideas to life through coding and design.
Whether I'm building projects, playing action games, or keeping up with the latest tech trends, I'm always pushing myself to grow and improve. I believe in staying curious, working hard, and enjoying the journey.

This website is a space where I share what Im learning, working on, and passionate about. Thanks for stopping by! </p>
        <p class="textabt1">I hope you find something interesting here. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or just want to chat about tech, gaming, or anything else!</p>
