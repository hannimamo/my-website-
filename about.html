Hi, I'm Hannibal a 21-year-old IT student at MCAST. Im originally from Libya and Malta, and currently living in Malta. In the future, I hope to move to Germany for better opportunities, both in life and in my studies.
Im passionate about technology, gaming, and sports—especially football and my favorite team, Real Madrid. I love figuring out how things work, solving problems, and bringing creative ideas to life through coding and design.
Whether Im building projects, playing action games, or keeping up with the latest tech trends, Im always striving to grow and improve. I believe in staying curious, working hard, and enjoying the journey along the way.
This website is where I share what Im learning, working on, and passionate about. Thanks for stopping by—I hope you find something here that interests or inspires you!
